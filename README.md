I started this project after my frustration with 4K Video Downloader. Initially, the video download limit per day 
(for the free version) was 30. After a routine update (4K has a lot of those) the limit came down to 10.
I had to come up with something that offered the same quality and speeds, without the limits.
In addition, I decided to add a regular download manager on top of it.

I decided on C++ but after crunching it for three weeks, I settled on Python. (For the libraries)

This here is the GUI, built with tkinter and customtkinter interchangeably.

The back end is also almost there but for some reason, I can't marry it to the front end.

PS: The app is in NO way complete and some (well lots) of help would be appreciated.
